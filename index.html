          <h2 class="big-title">About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm Chris, an American based in Paris. Soon to be (fingers crossed) A French citizen! I moved from San Antonio, Texas to Paris, France in September of 2019. It was a bit of a leap of faith as I had only visited once, but fell in love with the city. I hadn't yet learned French but I figured I could pick it up along the way, and 6 years later I am somewhat fluent! France has become my home and I don't see myself ever moving back to The United States.</p>

          <h2 class="big-title">My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
          <h3>Cooking:</h3>
          <p>Living in France has afforded me the luxury of learning about the history of cuisine and fully embracing the art of cooking. I enjoy the creative aspect of creating a meal with an immediate payoff of flavor.</p>
          <p>Whether it's just cooking a simple 3 ingredient recipe for myself, or a full <em>Entrée Plat Désert</em> menu for friends or family.</p>

          <h3>Music:</h3>
          <p>I have been playing the guitar since I was about 12 years old, so more than 25 years (ooph, I'm getting older). I played in a Rock and Roll band in Texas for a couple of years before relocating to Paris, which is a memory very close to my heart. Living in an apartment in Paris means focusing more on Acoustic guitar, which I've come to really enjoy playing as well.</p>
          <p>I am very passionate about music and pride myself on being able to find enjoyment in listening to all different genres.</p>
          <p>I also very much enjoy creating music with Digital Audio Workstations like Garageband. I've posted many pieces of music to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mr-cadwalter" target="_blank">my Soundcloud profile</a> over the years.</p>

          <h3>Running</h3>
          <p>In 2024 I started running, and it's grown on me to the point that now I find myself making time to go running instead of feeling like I have to exercise.</p>
          <p>I enjoy the simplicity and freedom of running. Knowing that it can be done anywhere in the world at anytime, and with minimal equipment makes me appreciate it even more.</p>
          <p>In March 2025 I ran my first Half Marathon in Paris!</p>
